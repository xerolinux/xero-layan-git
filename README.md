# This is XeroLinux's Layan Rice

### Disclaimer

I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. We use custom themes in every one of our rices, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of our hands.

### Performance :

This rice as with most of our rices has been throughly optimized for best performance on higher-end systems.. Although it might work on lower-end ones, for better performance I do not recommend that you use it there. So please do not report any performance issues.

### Installation

**Install At Own Risk!!!**.. As of now it has *initial* **Plasma 6** support with more work being done, test it out and report any issues via issue tracker on here and I will get right on it. To do so please follow the commands posted below. You will need either **Paru** or **Yay** installed. Keep in mind that this will replace some files. I recommend you do a backup first. Upto you...

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-layan-git
cd xero-layan-git/ && ./install.sh
```

### Your Settings

Keep in mind that it will backup some app settings & all system ones before applying and overriding them with new ones, you will be able to restore what you need from the backup, so please do not report that. You have been warned. In case of any issues please find us on our [Forum]([https://discord.gg/Xg6T78ahtK](https://forum.xerolinux.xyz/forum-34.html)). Best of luck !
