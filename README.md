# This is XeroLinux's Layan Rice

### Disclaimer

I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. We use custom themes, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of our hands.
