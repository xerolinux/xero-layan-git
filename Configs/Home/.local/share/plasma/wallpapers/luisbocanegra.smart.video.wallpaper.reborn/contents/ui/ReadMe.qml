The Video wallpaper plugin started as a KDE forums answer /1/. \n\nNotes\n\nThe Video wallpaper will need gstreamer plugins to play video/audio. To get possible error messages launch the plasmashell or the lockscreen from the terminal /2/.\n\nThe CPU load will decrease if you use less compressed video format and use smaller resolution videos.\n\nThe Qt is lacking gapless media player /3/. The realod of the media can be hide by using two media players /4/ - option 'Use double player'.\n\nWith the latest plasma (post 5.10) the lock screen doesn't have the audio with the video wallpaper /5/. \n\nLinks\n\n[1] https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=289&t=131783\n[2] https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=289&t=131783&start=45#p382975\n[3] https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-49446\n[4] https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=289&t=131783&start=15#p365313\n[5] https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=289&t=131783&start=45#p383041"
